# URLEncoding

To help pass special or reserved characters through URL’s to the application, they must first be urlencoded. Most platforms provide such a feature. Following is a limited list of reserved characters you can provide the encoding to. Note this is NOT a comprehensive list, but a limited set provided for example only.

For a more comprehensive list, see <http://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_urlencode.asp>

| Character | Encoded |
|-----------|---------|
| \<space\> | %20     |
| ?         | %3F     |
| &         | %26     |
| “         | %22     |
| %         | %25     |
| /         | %2F     |
| =         | %3D     |
